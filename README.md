# ESP8266_SandBox

This repository is my personal space to learn and practice programming the ESP8266 NodeMCU V3 board using PlatformIO.  
It contains example projects, experiments, and code snippets to build practical skills and explore ESP8266 features.  
I will keep updating it with new projects as I gain experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/that9to5guy/ESP8266_SandBox.git
   ```

2. Open the folder in VS Code with the PlatformIO extension installed.

3. Build and upload code to your ESP8266 NodeMCU V3 board.

## Requirements

- ESP8266 NodeMCU V3 development board  
- USB cable to connect the board to your PC  
- USB-to-Serial drivers installed (e.g., CP2102 or CH340 drivers depending on your board)  
- PlatformIO IDE (recommended as a VS Code extension)  
- Basic knowledge of C/C++ and microcontroller programming
